        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
          This project is a simple project that demonstration of the A* algorithm that are implemented on a 2D map, a start and end point is provided, and the goal is to reach the destination with lowest cost. The shallow blue tire indicates that the pass through that block will causing cost of 1, and 2 for deep blue tire, the green tire indicated the land which will cost the highest: 5. Based on this logic I implemented A* algorithm on this build.  
As a introduction of this project, the basic map build and the start and end locations are provided by the Monash FIT teaching team, as a student, our assessment is to find out the proper algorithm that guide the ship to the set destination with minimum cost, and avoid as many collision among the ship as possible. And the map is a structured grid, each cell representing potential pathways or obstacles, then I implemented A*, the algorithm inspects neighboring nodes to determine the most efficient route. And the Manhattan distance calculates the straight-line cost from a node to the goal, ensuring pathfinding remains swift and optimal.
