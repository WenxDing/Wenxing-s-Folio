        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
          Here is a basic introduction of this project, the green ships are called Harvester ship, and this ship have
          its own observe hemisphere and collision hemisphere, the observe hemisphere is 2 times bigger than the
          collision hemisphere. And each Harvester ship are affected by the following forces: Boid avoidance, velocity
          matching, flock centering, static obstacle avoidance, migration, and pirate avoidance. As every frame of the
          gameplay, each of these vectors will be calculated by the device and make the harvester ship move within the
          space provided.
          The space and the base code are provided by the Monash FIT team, as a student, my work related to this project
          is to create an evolutionary algorithm that make each harvester and pirate ship get high point and make each
          “generation” of the boids live longer. The pirate ship has similar functions and forces as the Harvester does,
          the only difference is that the pirate ship will chase the Harvester ships, while its collision hemisphere
          touches the Harvester’s collision hemisphere, it will “eat” the harvester’s point (fitness which will be
          discussed later.)
          After the playground and the boids are generated within the map, the genotype which contains the ratio of each
          force mentioned above will be generated, and then the function will select a few boids for Harvester and
          pirate as the pirate of next generation. The parents are selected within the top 10 boids of each generation.
          As the parents are selected, the next generation boid’s genotype is made by the attributes of the parents’
          ship. With some random mutations. And the random mutations is quite complicated, because each force mentioned
          earlier have different ratio range, so the random ration of each force are set within this range.
          After a new set of genotypes of new generation of the boids are generated, all the exist boids on the
          playground will be erased and generate new set of the boids with the new-generated genotype applied.
